## 1.1 Trump's New Tariff Policy

Former President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a universal 10% tariff on most foreign imports if elected in 2024. The proposed policy would particularly impact trade relations with Mexico, Canada, and China. According to economic analysts, this could significantly affect American consumers and businesses.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded firmly to the announcement, promising a "swift and strong response" to protect Canadian interests. He emphasized that such tariffs would violate existing trade agreements and harm both economies.

The proposed tariffs could lead to increased prices for everyday items including gasoline, food, and automobiles. Economic experts warn that this could trigger a new wave of inflation and potential trade wars with major trading partners.
